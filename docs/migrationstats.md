### Migration statistics (Logs) 
The statistics dashboard can be used for analysis on the overall status viz., Success, Exceptions
(converted as standard tables or unsupported visuals) and Errors (unsupported back-end aspects)
of the migrations at the Page, Chart and Property levels for all applications.

Users can drill down or roll-up for abstracted views or use the date and time filters to understand
specific migrations â€“ for both front-end and back-end aspects.
